Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope.
With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object

This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, 
but can be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in value,
but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.
For example, in a module that wants to implement an open() function that wraps the built-in open(), this module can be used directly

output is __main__
